# Getting started with RFSoC-PYNQ

RFSoC-PYNQ is delivered as an SD Card image for supported boards. The image is copied to an SD card which is used to boot an RFSoC development board and run PYNQ.  

## Supported boards 

RFSoC-PYNQ images are available for the following boards and can be downloaded from the [PYNQ.io board images](http://www.pynq.io/board) webpage.

* RFSoC 2x2
* RFSoC 4x2
* ZCU111
* ZCU208

## Other RFSoC-PYNQ enabled boards

RFSoC-PYNQ images have been created by PYNQ community members for other RFSoC boards:

If an image is not available for your board you can build your own custom RFSoC-PYNQ image by following the [instructions for the ZCU216 RFSoC-PYNQ image build](https://github.com/sarafs1926/ZCU216-PYNQ).

## Getting started

The board overview pages will give an overview of each board. The getting started guides will walk you through the process of setting up your board, connecting to it, and running your first RFSoC-PYNQ notebook.
