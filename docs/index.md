# New free eBook: SDR with Zynq Ultrascale+ RFSoC 

<img src="./images/rfsoc_book_banner.png">

This book introduces Zynq Ultrascale+ RFSoC, a technology that brings real, single-chip, Software 
Defined Radio (SDR) to the marketplace. The book is accompanied by Jupyter Notebooks that can be run on
 your RFSoC-PYNQ enabled board, illustrating key concepts including *sampling* and *quantisation*, *filter
 design*, *Fourier's theorem* and *FFTs*, *pulse shaping*, *QAM*, *frequency planning*, *Forward-Error-Correction*, 
and *OFDM*. 

See the book website [www.rfsocbook.com](https://www.rfsocbook.com/) to download your **free** copy of the eBook and details on how to purchase hard copies. 

# New RFSoC-PYNQ release

The latest RFSoC-PYNQ 3.0 release adds supports for the [ZCU208](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu208.html) alongside the existing support for the [RFSoC 4x2](./rfsoc_4x2_overview.html), [RFSoC 2x2](rfsoc_2x2_overview.html), and [ZCU111](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu111.html).

**RFSOC-PYNQ** is an extension to [PYNQ](http://www.pynq.io/) bringing support for the AMD-Xilinx Zynq [RFSoC](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/rfsoc.html) family of devices. RFSoC created a new class of integrated circuit architecture for the communications and instrumentation markets. RFSoC combines high-accuracy ADCs and DACs operating at Giga samples per second (GSPS), with programmable heterogeneous compute engines.

RFSoC-PYNQ provides Python APIs, libraries and drivers for the RFSoC, example overlays and designs, tutorials and other resources for RFSoC users.

#### RFSoC-PYNQ features

* [PYNQ framework](http://www.pynq.io) with Jupyter Lab for exceptional ease-of-use
* *Python APIs* for RFSoC clock and data converters 
* Support for RFSoC Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 devices including the [AMD University Program RFSoC 4x2](rfsoc_4x2_overview.md)
* Complete end-to-end reference designs including spectrum analyzers and software defined radios (see [Overlays](overlays.html))
* Open-source [educational resources](educational_resources.html) including teaching materials, notebooks, and design examples
* [GitHub-hosted repositories](https://github.com/Xilinx/RFSoC4x2-PYNQ) of all project materials
  
The [RFSoC 4x2](rfsoc_4x2_overview.html) is the recommended kit to get started using RFSoC-PYNQ.
