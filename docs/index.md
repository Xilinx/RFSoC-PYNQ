# New RFSoC 4x2

We are delighted to announce the launch of our new RFSoC 4x2 kits. The new kits greatly improve on
the performance of the older RFSoC 2x2 kits, at the same $2,149 academic price. 

Due to global supply challenges the [RFSoC 2x2  kits](rfsoc_2x2_overview.html) are discontinued but software support for existing boards will continue.

## Key features

# RFSoC-PYNQ

<img style="float: right; margin: 0px 20px 0px 40px"  src="./images/xilinx-zynq-rfsoc-color-rgb-logo.png">

RFSOC-PYNQ is an extension to [PYNQ](http://www.pynq.io/) bringing support for the AMD-Xilinx Zynq [RFSoC](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/rfsoc.html) family of devices. RFSoC created a new class of integrated circuit architecture for the communications and instrumentation markets. RFSoCs combine high-accuracy ADCs and DACs operating at Giga samples per second (GSPS), with programmable heterogeneous compute engines.

RFSoC-PYNQ provides Python APIs, libraries and drivers for the RFSoC, example overlays and designs, tutorials and other resources for RFSoC users.
