**RFSOC-PYNQ** is an extension to [PYNQ](http://www.pynq.io/) bringing support for the AMD-Xilinx Zynq [RFSoC](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/rfsoc.html) family of devices. RFSoC created a new class of integrated circuit architecture for the communications and instrumentation markets. RFSoC combines high-accuracy ADCs and DACs operating at Giga samples per second (GSPS), with programmable heterogeneous compute engines.

RFSoC-PYNQ provides Python APIs, libraries and drivers for the RFSoC, example overlays and designs, tutorials and other resources for RFSoC users. 

#### RFSoC-PYNQ features

* [PYNQ framework](http://www.pynq.io) with Jupyter Lab for exceptional ease-of-use
* *Python APIs* for RFSoC clock and data converters 
* Support for RFSoC Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 devices including the [AMD University Program RFSoC 4x2](rfsoc_4x2_overview.md)
* Complete end-to-end reference designs including spectrum analyzers and software defined radios (see [Overlays](overlays.html))
* Open-source [educational resources](educational_resources.html) including teaching materials, notebooks, and design examples
* [GitHub-hosted repositories](https://github.com/Xilinx/RFSoC4x2-PYNQ) of all project materials
  
The [RFSoC 4x2](rfsoc_4x2_overview.html) is the recommended kit to get started using RFSoC-PYNQ.

#### RFSoC 4x2 key features

* New **Gen 3** Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC ZU48DR
* Faster **5GSPS** ADCs and **9.85GSPS** DACs
* Higher resolution **14-bit** ADCs
* Maximum RF input frequency increased to 6 GHz
* **Two** additional ADCs (four in total)
* New **high-speed QSFP28** interface supporting 4x25Gbps, 2x50Gbps or 1x100Gbps Ethernet 
* New **OLED** display for improved boot-time status
* New battery-backed **real-time clock**
* Upgraded open-source **Overlays** including **Spectrum Analyzer** design supporting higher RFSoC Gen 3 ADC/DAC frequencies and wider bandwidth
