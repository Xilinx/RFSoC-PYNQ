    """Driver for the transmit control IP Core.
    
    The Amplitude Controller is a simple IP core written
    in VHDL. The core outputs a user defined value on the master
    AXI-Stream interface when the enable register is high.
    This core was purposely designed to communicate with the
    RF Digital-to-Analogue Converter (RF DAC). The user
    can set the amplitude of the signal written to the RF DAC
    and use the RF DAC's fine mixer to generate a tone for
    loopback purposes on their development board.

    ----------
    enable : a bool
        If high, enables the output of the gain register on to
        the master AXI-Stream interface.
        
    gain : a float
        A float in Volts, that describes the amplitude of the
        output master AXI-Stream signal. Must be in range 0 to 1.
