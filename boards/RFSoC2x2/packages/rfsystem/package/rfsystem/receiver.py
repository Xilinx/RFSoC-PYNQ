    """Driver for the Packet Generator core.
    
    The Packet Generator is a simple IP core written in
    VHDL. The core is used to generate AXI-Stream packets
    for interfacing to an AXI DMA. The AXI-Stream packets
    are written to the master AXI-Stream interface when
    requested by the user through the transfer register.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    packetsize : an int
        The packetsize defines the number of valid samples
        between the start of an AXI-Stream packet and a valid
        tlast strobe. The acceptable range is an int between
        2 and 4096.
        
    transfer : a bool
        The transfer property allows the user to communicate
        with the packet generator, such that an AXI-Stream
        packet of size packetsize, is transferred to the
        master AXI-Stream interface on the rising edge.
